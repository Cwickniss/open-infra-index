# Hello, DeepSeek Open Infra!

## 202502 Open-Source Week
We're a tiny team @deepseek-ai pushing our limits in AGI exploration.

Starting **next week**, we'll open-source 5 repos â€“ one daily drop â€“ not because we've made grand claims, 
but simply as developers sharing our small-but-sincere progress with full transparency.

These are humble building blocks of our online service: documented, deployed and battle-tested in production. 
No vaporware, just code that moved our tiny moonshot forward.

Why? Because every line shared becomes collective momentum that accelerates the journey.
Daily unlocks begin soon. No ivory towers - just pure garage-energy and community-driven innovation ðŸ”§

Stay tuned â€“ let's geek out in the open together.
